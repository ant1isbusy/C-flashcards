# C-flashcards

A simple flashcard app that allows you to view flashcards, rendered in SDL2. The flashcards are stored in a .txt file, with a tab separating the front and back of the cards. Written in C.

Designed to have a minimal aesthetic, avoiding bloat of other flashcard apps.

The flashcard format is very simple, it is stored as a txt, where we have front-back pairs on each line, seperated by a tab. The simplicity of it makes it great to use with LLMs to generate flashcards. (Anki can also export to this format).
